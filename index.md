  Hello! I'm an incoming PhD student in computer science at Columbia University. I will be advised by Professor Julia Hirschberg as a member of the Spoken Language Processing Group. My broad research interests lie in natural language processing, [computational linguistics](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.39.pdf), and [computational](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12516.pdf) [social science](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13041.pdf). 
  
  Prior to Columbia, I earned my BSc and MEng at Cornell University, where I majored in computer science and minored in linguistics. At Cornell, I was fortunate to work with Professors Marten van Schijndel and Thomas Davidson.
