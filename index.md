# DEBASMITA BHATTACHARYA

Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in computer science at Columbia University. I am grateful to be advised by [Professor Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/) as a member of the [Spoken Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/). I am broadly interested in multilingual natural language and speech processing and computational linguistics. 

Prior to Columbia, I earned my BSc and MEng at Cornell University, where I majored in computer science and minored in linguistics. <br />
At Cornell, I was fortunate to work with [Professor Thomas Davidson](https://www.thomasrdavidson.com/) <br /> and [Professor Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/). 

As of 2022, I am a [Croucher Scholar](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/).
