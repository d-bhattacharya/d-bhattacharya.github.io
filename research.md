Previously, I investigated [how well neural networks "understand" abstract English syntax](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.39.pdf). I have also worked on [racial bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12516.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com) and [abusive language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13041.pdf).
