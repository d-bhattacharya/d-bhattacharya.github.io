      alt: code-switching
    description: I am currently examining the relationship between spoken code-switching and other aspects of language production, including empathy and entrainment. I am also exploring written code-switching from the perspective of psycholinguistic information theory. Separate from code-switching, I am interested in measuring the linguistic notion of formality in speech.

    description: Previously, I investigated <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.39.pdf">how well neural networks "understand" abstract English syntax</a>. I have also worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12516.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com">racial bias</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13041.pdf"> abusive language</a>, and xenophobia on Twitter.
